All supporting documents must be scanned and uploaded with your application.  
All documents that you provide must be certified copies of original documents.  
Do not include original documents unless specifically requested to do so by the department.  
Documents not in English must be accompanied by accredited English translations.  

Documents to show identity
Scanned colour copies of the biographical pages of the current passports or travel documents of all people included in the application.  
Recent, scanned passport-sized photograph (45 mm x 35 mm) of you and each other person included in the application.  
Alternatively, digital photos can also be provided.   
Each photograph should:
    * be of the head and shoulders against a plain background and
    * be labelled with the applicant's name.

Employment references must meet the following requirements:
be written on the official letterhead of the company or government department providing the reference;
the letterhead should indicate clearly the full address of the company and any telephone, fax numbers, e-mail and website addresses;
the name and position of the person authorised to sign the employment reference should be typed or stamped below that person’s signature;
the contact telephone number of the person writing the reference should be included in the letter;
the letter should indicate the exact period of employment (including whether permanent or temporary, full or part-time), position(s) held, the duties undertaken and the salary earned - positions should not be described by generic titles (eg. research officer, public servant) but according to the nature of the duties undertaken (eg. research chemist, accounts clerk); and
a payslip from your current employment should also be included – this is especially important from applicants working in government departments.
