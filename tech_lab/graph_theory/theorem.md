**1.1**:
    In a graph G, the sum of the degrees of the vertices is equal to twice of the edge numbers. As a consquence, the number of vertices with odd degrees is even.

**1.2**
    In a graph G with vertices u and v, every u-v walk contains a u-v path.


### Unsorted

1. Every 2-connected graph contains at least one cycle.
2. For every graph `G`, its connectivity `k(G)` is equal or less than its minimum vertice degree `δ(G)`, which denotes as `k(G) <= δ(G)`.
